description: "There is nothing in the world at a macroscopic level that has been co-ordinated with such finesse, on such a grand scale as the billions of transistors moving in sync inside a modern CPU chip, and to work with it correctly you need to understand how all it really comes down to, is controlled chaos."

## Computing and Computers
Computers are powerful, flexible and magical machines that perform calculations by processing information through an input and returning output. At it's core it is just a device with processor and memory - the rest of the details about design (mechanical, electrical, optical or quantum) are optional. 

The history of computing is a history of building abstractions. 

Machines working for us became machines thinking for us.

History of adding value through technology is through leverage.
