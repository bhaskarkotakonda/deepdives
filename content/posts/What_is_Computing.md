> The computer is the most powerful tool ever invented by humanity. In your pocket, you're carrying the single most powerful thing that all of humanity has ever invented ... Every little bit you can do to figure out how to use that better than you did before is going to give you enormous leverage. - *Naval Ravikanth*

Machines working for us became machines thinking for us.
