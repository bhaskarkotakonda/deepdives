description: "There is nothing in the world at a macroscopic level that has been co-ordinated with such finesse, on such a grand scale as the billions of transistors moving in sync inside a modern CPU chip, and to work with it correctly you need to understand how all it really comes down to, is controlled chaos."

The need for performing computations is an ancient one, right from the time of Mesopotomians around 4000BC. Till about the time of 1970s, computers could very well even mean human computers who sat down in research laboratories looking up

## What exactly is a computer?
Computers are powerful, flexible and magical machines that perform calculations by processing information through an input and returning output. At it's core it is just a device with processor and memory - the rest of the details about design (mechanical, electrical, optical or quantum) are optional. 


## Evolution of Computers
The history of adding value through technology is through leverage.
