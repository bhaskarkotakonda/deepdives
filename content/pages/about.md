My name is [Bhaskar Kotakonda](https://bhaskarkotakonda.github.io/) and I started this space to bring together my two passions - writing and technology. When I first started reading some of the popular science and technology blogs, I found it difficult to follow the terminologies and jargon that were so commonly used. My initial response was to break down the parts I did not completely understand and find more basic resources that could help me develop the fundamental knowledge for that topic. This space is an effort to bring together such lines of thought and present it in essays, navigating the question through much fundamental questions until each of the building blocks are assimilated - much similar to the Feynman's technique. 

Some of the blogs I take inspiration from for their writing style and topics -
